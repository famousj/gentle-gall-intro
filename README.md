# A Gentle Introduction to Gall

## Intro

This section WIP

KM Describe what 

This doc assumes you have some idea of [what Hoon is](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/hoon/).  Ideally you should have finished [Hoon School through part 1](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school/).  If you don't know what a [core](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school/arms-and-cores/) or a [door](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school/doors/) are, you're going to have a bad time.

Ideally you would also know at least one other programming language and some familiarity with computer science topics.  This will hopefully not be required.

Also, in later chapters, when we start plugging things into Landscape, you'll need some familiarity with web programming.  At the very least you should know how to spell HTML.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, whatever, send a DM to ~ribben-donnyl

If you find this really useful, feel free to toss a couple of satoshis my way.


Before you get started, you might want to read the [workflow](https://github.com/timlucmiptev/gall-guide/blob/master/workflow.md) section of the OG [Gall guide](https://github.com/timlucmiptev/gall-guide), (to which this introduction owes a tremendous gratitude, by the way).

Make sure you've setup a [fake ~zod](https://urbit.org/docs/development/environment/).  I wrote all the examples to run in a fake ~zod, and I'll assume you've done the same.  Note that developing apps on your personal Urbit ship on the live network is considered harmful.
