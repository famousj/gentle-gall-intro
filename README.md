# A Gentle Introduction to Gall

This section WIP

KM Describe what a gall agent

This doc assumes you have some idea of [what Hoon is](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/hoon/).  Preferrably you should have finished [Hoon School through part 1](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school/).  If you don't know what a [core](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school/arms-and-cores/) or a [door](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school/doors/) are, you're going to have a bad time.

Ideally you should also know at least one other programming language and some familiarity with computer science topics.  I'll try to break things down, so hopefully this will be helpful but not necessary.

Also, in later chapters, when we start plugging things into Landscape, you'll need some familiarity with web programming.  At the very least you should know how to spell HTML.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, whatever, send a DM to ~ribben-donnyl.

Before you get started, you might want to read the [workflow](https://github.com/timlucmiptev/gall-guide/blob/master/workflow.md) section of the OG [Gall guide](https://github.com/timlucmiptev/gall-guide), (to which this introduction owes a tremendous gratitude, by the way).

I wrote all the examples for running on a fake ~zod, so if you don't have one of those setup, [please do that now](https://urbit.org/docs/development/environment/).  Note that developing apps on your personal Urbit ship on the live network is not generally considered a good idea.
